Hi, this is an simple project which is an game and which can be played between two players.

# Tic Tac Toe Game

A classic **Tic Tac Toe** game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid.  
The first player to get three in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — wins!

## How It Works
- The game is played on a 3×3 board.
- Player 1 uses **X** and Player 2 uses **O**.
- Players take turns choosing an empty square.
- The game ends when:
  - A player gets 3 in a row (win)
  - All squares are filled (draw)

## Features
- Two-player local gameplay
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Displays winner or draw at the end
- Option to restart the game
